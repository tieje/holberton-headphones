    Holberton Headphones: the perfect headphones for studying coding.

    - complete noise-canceling: our noise-canceling feature creates an quiet environment akin to the quietest room in the world. The world-record of staying in the world's quietest room is about 45 minutes. Feel the existentialism tearing at your soul!
    
    - tune out the world with your tunes: our headphones create an addictive experience, often compared to opium! Feel the bliss of perpetual addiction.
